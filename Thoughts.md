# QM-on-Information

* Information is based on history, with absolutely ignorance of futrue (prior of time). (causality remians)
* A state of the system is identical to system's information in isolated view point.
* The superposition of states reflects (or as one of the mechanism) the fusion (融合) of 
two systems's information into one general (bigger) information.
* The Born's rule, that the square of absolute value of amplitude of superpositin equals to the probability of ocurring (collapsing to) 
certain sub-state, reflects (or also as one of the mechanism), in the process of mesurement, the decomposion of system's information into 
subsystem' infromtion (smaller). This statement also applies for the state density formalism.
* The "samll" and "big" may represent the degree of freedom of a system.
* The interaction between systems' information is non-local.
* The fusion of systems is a conclusive and overall statement of such interaction. 
* The fusion is stronger (has greater change on the whole compared to subsystem, similar to (or equivelant to) the emergence of new properties in condense matter
physics) between nearby systems ("near" meaning the quantity of one of parameters, e.g. position, time, is close).

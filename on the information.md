# Assumptions of information

* The definition of information: the basic element of information is the concept of exsitence; _it exsits_ is the piece of the information.
* We can divide a world point into two states: nothing, and the pair of exsitence and non-exsitence. 
* The pair of exsitence and non-exsitence allways simultanuously appears, and is mixed in spacetime due to dynamics of the pair and interaction with other pairs.
